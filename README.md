<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

When a text editor is outfitted with collaborative editing capabilities, and real time conversation it can be a show stopper. There are a number of applications available that excel at offering such functionality.
I wanted to design and build a system that could handle simple text editing along with communication and collaboration. Using the Code Xerox, several users may collaborate on documents in real time. The current editing stances of other users are always visible via Remote-Cursors.


## Main feature of the code xerox are as follows
* Multiple users can edit code in real time. :revolving_hearts:
* You can communicate in real time via video andd audio call :phone:
* Syntax highlighting is present currently supporting C-like languages. :smile:
* You can create as many rooms as you want [but currently have a scalibility issues] :hugs:
* You can also chat in chat window :speech_balloon:
